Welcome To Carl Malcolm-Clarke's official portfolio.
In case you're worried about the lack of information, layout, or links,
don't be too concerned because I've made this entire portfolio in one weekend with a language I'm not too familiar with! 
This portfolio was created with React.

My proficiencies include:

- Git
- Java
- Javascript
- nodejs/NPM
- CLI

My tools of choice:

- Intellj
- Vscode
- Postman


My style of development is minimalistic with powerful responsive functionality. 
I am open to learning many more development styles.
I'm a self-taught developer so solo learning is in my blood.
To be honest I feel like I would advance much quicker with hands on experience and with a team by my side.

This portfolio will include more as time goes on but I still have much more to learn.
